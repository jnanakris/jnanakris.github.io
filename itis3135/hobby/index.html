            <h2>Welcome to the World of Mountain Biking</h2>
            <p>Mountain biking is an exhilarating outdoor activity that combines adventure, exercise, and a connection with nature. Riders navigate trails of varying difficulty through forests, mountains, and various terrains on specially designed bikes.</p>

            <p class="prompt-description">Image prompt: "A mountain biker riding through a forest trail, morning light filtering through trees, photorealistic style, action shot from the side, no people visible in the foreground."</p>
            
            <p>Modern mountain biking evolved in the 1970s in California when cyclists began exploring off-road trails with modified bicycles. Today, it has grown into a diverse sport with multiple disciplines including cross-country, trail riding, all-mountain, downhill, freeride, and dirt jumping.</p>
            
            <p>Whether you're seeking adrenaline rushes down steep descents, peaceful rides through scenic terrain, or the physical challenge of climbing technical trails, mountain biking offers something for everyone.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Who/About Me Section -->
        <section id="who">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My journey with mountain biking began five years ago when I was looking for an outdoor activity that combined adventure, exercise, and exploration. What started as weekend rides on local trails quickly evolved into a passion that has taken me across numerous trail systems throughout the United States.</p>

            <p class="prompt-description">Image prompt: "Mountain biker taking a break on a scenic overlook, wearing helmet and sunglasses, looking at the camera, mountains in background, natural lighting, photorealistic."</p>
            
            <p>I primarily ride trail and all-mountain styles, preferring the balanced experience of both climbs and descents. My current ride is a 2023 Santa Cruz Tallboy with 120mm of travel - the perfect companion for the technical but flowing trails I prefer.</p>
            
            <p>Through mountain biking, I've connected with an incredible community of riders, improved my physical fitness dramatically, and discovered hidden natural gems I would have never encountered otherwise. The sport has become more than just a hobby - it's a lifestyle that has shaped how I plan vacations, spend weekends, and even the friends I've made along the way.</p>

Evening rides feature beautiful lighting and cooler temperatures after hot days. Avoiding midday rides during summer months is recommended due to heat and higher UV exposure.</p>

            <h3>Essential Gear:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bike</strong> - Start with a hardtail or entry-level full-suspension mountain bike.</li>

                <li><strong>Gloves</strong> - Protect hands and improve grip.</li>
                <li><strong>Eye Protection</strong> - Shield eyes from debris, insects, and branches.</li>
                <li><strong>Water System</strong> - Hydration pack or water bottles.</li>
                <li><strong>Basic Tool Kit</strong> - Multi-tool, spare tube, tire levers, and pump.</li>

            <p>As you build confidence, gradually progress to more challenging trails, always riding within your ability level. Remember that everyone progresses at their own pace, and the goal is to have fun while staying safe.</p>

            <h3>JavaScript Section Navigation Prompt:</h3>
            <div class="prompt-description">
                "Write JavaScript code that implements section navigation for a single-page website. When a user clicks on a navigation link, it should hide all sections and only display the one corresponding to the clicked link. The code should ensure that when a section is picked, all other sections are hidden and cannot be seen by the user until they click something else. Additionally, add an active state to the selected navigation link. The default section to show when the page loads should be the 'what' section."

Include responsive design elements, proper spacing, visual hierarchy, and consistent styling across all sections. Add hover effects for interactive elements and ensure good readability with appropriate font choices."
